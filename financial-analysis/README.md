Blog post which educated and inspired me in building this entire report -
* [DataCamp tutorial, Python For Finance : Algorithmic Trading](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/finance-python-trading)
<br></br>
# Aim of the Study
1. Analyze overall Bitcoin performance **in comparison with** S&P 500 and Gold<br></br>
2. Determine Risk and Volatility of fund investment in Bitcoin **in comparison with** existing benchmark assets (S&P 500)<br></br>
3. Possibility of Hedging against Inflation **in comparison with** existing hedge investments (Gold)<br></br>

# Hypothesis

### *Experimental View (HA)*
Investment in Bitcoin is an opportunity for Fund growth, given risks are minimized and adds value to the existing portfolio

# Approach
1. Calculate Difference and Mean for daily stock prices
2. Risk Analysis of Bitcoin inclusion in the portfolio by calculating:
    - Returns
    - Moving Window Averages
    - Asset Volatility
    - Correlation analysis between Assets and Inflation
3. Conclude whether or not to include Bitcoin in portfolio based on Risk Analysis
